package zork;/** * Class Game - the main class of the "Zork" game. * * Author:  Michael Kolling * Version: 1.1 * Date:    March 2000 *  *  This class is the main class of the "Zork" application. Zork is a very *  simple, text based adventure game.  Users can walk around some scenery. *  That's all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting! *  *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" *  routine. *  *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates the *  commands that the parser returns. */public class Game {		private Parser parser;	private boolean hasKey = false;	private Room currentRoom;	private Room cell,corridor, kitchen, securityWing, court, exitGate;	/**	 * Create the game and initialise its internal map.	 */	public Game() {				parser = new Parser();				// Create all the rooms and link their exits together.		cell = new Room("You are in your cell.

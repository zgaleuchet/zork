Zork is a very * simple, text based adventure game.  Users can walk around some scenery. * That's all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting! * <p> * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" * routine. * <p> * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates the * commands that the parser returns. */public class Game {    private Parser parser;    private boolean hasKey = false;    private boolean hasEaten = false;    private Room currentRoom;    private Room cell, corridor, kitchen, securityWing, court, exitGate;    private String username;    private StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();    /**     * Create the game and initialise its internal map.     */    public Game() {        RoomArt roomArt = new RoomArt();        parser = new Parser();        // Create all the rooms and link their exits together.        cell = new Room("You are in your cell. \nThe guard dropped his key on the ground.

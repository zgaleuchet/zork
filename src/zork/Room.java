package zork;/* * Class Room - a room in an adventure game. * * Author:  Michael Kolling * Version: 1.1 * Date:    August 2000 *  * This class is part of Zork. Zork is a simple, text based adventure game. * * "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is  * connected to at most four other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled * north, east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference * to the neighbouring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction. */import java.util.HashMap;public class Room {		private String description;	private boolean hasFakeKey = false;	private boolean hasKey = false;	private boolean isClose = false;	private HashMap<String,Room> exits; // stores exits of this room.	/**	 * getter und setter	 */	public boolean getFakeKey() {		return hasFakeKey;	}	public void setFakeKey(boolean hasFakeKey) {		this.hasFakeKey = hasFakeKey;	}	public boolean getKey() {		return hasKey;	}	public void setKey(boolean hasKey) {		this.hasKey = hasKey;	}	public boolean isClosed() {		return isClose;	}	public void setClose(boolean close) {		isClose = close;	}	/**	 * Create a room described "description".
